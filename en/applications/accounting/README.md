# Accounting | Applications | EN | OFBiz
It is the core application component and has most of the modern features you would expect in a general purpose double-entry accounting system.

Like many of the applications that come with OFBiz it seamlessly integrates with other OFBiz applications such as [Inventory](../inventory/README.md), [Purchasing](../purchasing/README.md) and [Manufacturing](../manufacturing/README.md). All this makes OFBiz a more valuable accounting system.
